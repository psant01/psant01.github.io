    <h2>UK STEM Ambassador</h2>
    <p>Since 2018 I have been an active ambassador (STEM) via the UK STEM Ambassadoe network. This means that I volunteer to visit school and colleges
    and to engage with a variety of outreach activities including demos, career talks etc. I really enjoy this, and if you are interested
    in becoming a UK STEM Ambassador then please visit <a href="https://stem.org.uk">UK STEM Ambassador website</a></p>

    <h2>External examining</h2>

    <p>As partof my academic role I also engage as an external examiner for a couple of UK Universities. This provides me with insight
    as to how other institutions approach assessment and learning as well as being able to gather good practice and share thoughts and ideas. </p>
